# Table Maker - a plugin for Craft

A field type that enables your users to create their own columns, controlling the width and alignment of each:

![columns](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/supercoolplugins/Table-Maker/columns.jpg)

They can then fill in the data like a normal Table field and access both the columns and rows in Twig:

![rows](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/supercoolplugins/Table-Maker/rows.jpg)

See the [docs](http://plugins.supercooldesign.co.uk/plugin/table-maker/docs) for more details on installation and templating.
